# Nest Example

A simple NestJS application.

## Setup

Run the setup command. This drops and recreates the database, installs any
dependencies, runs the DB migrations, and builds the assets:

```
script/setup
```

## Running the application

```
script/server
```

## Running the tests

```
script/test
```

## Rebuilding the assets

If you make any changes to the assets, run:

```
npm run build:assets
```

There's probably a way to automatically watch these, but that's for later...
